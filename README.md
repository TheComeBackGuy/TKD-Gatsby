  Theatre Knoxville Downtown - Retool

## Before and After

`Before:` https://www.theatreknoxville.com/

`After:` https://theatreknoxville.netlify.app/

## Project Goals

1.  **Shorter Load Time**

    The current TKD site loads at 7 to 12 seconds and is bogged down by large images and Wordpress themes. I was able to get that down to a couple hundred miliseconds by recoding it from the ground up.

2.  **Not a Redesign**

    Current site is run by a Wordpress theme and seems to just be the default values without a real sense of design by it. My intent wasn't to do anything drastic in design terms, but some things needed to be organized and no visual language existed. So, things were slightly altered to give the site a more coheasive look and feel.

3.  **Controlled Data**

    Presently, all data on the site is just static on each page. So, editing the site can mean visiting several pages to change one detail. This also means the site needs to be updated anytime anything from a production ending/beginning to changing the Auditions page to updating a director.

    Updated design is all controlled by JSON data. From the reviews, to the shows, to the sponsorship price points. The site automatically updates when a production ends and posts the new show banner and info. It also updates the Auditions page so that when the current show starts, it posts the available information for the next show. Aside from adding actors to shows and changes in schedule, this site could theoretically be run the whole season without the need of being updated.

4.  **Still in Production**

    There are admittedly many more improvements I'd like to make on this project and I'm still looking for improvements to be made.
